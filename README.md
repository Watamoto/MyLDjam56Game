# MyLDjam56Game
Project for LDjam 56

Create folder, and upload the contents of each archive(Godot and WithoutDotGodot) to this folder, after which you can run the project.godot in Godot 4 and higher.

Bugfixes:

  1) Sprites (Teeth, Shadows in transitions), always on the right layers.
  
  2) Rare upgrades now have a 20% chance of spawn instead of 80% as it was before.
  
  3) Statistics (Hp and Points for eating) of big and small food were mixed up, now everything is working correctly.
  
  4) Gemini is now a fully functional character (Leveling is no longer reset between levels, and objects do not interact with Gemini)
  
  5) Now upgrades are queued up, and you can't get only 1 upgrade for 2-3 levels taken at once.
  
  6) The health bar now does not disappear from Gemini 2 during sleep.
